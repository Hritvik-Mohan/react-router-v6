# react-router-v6

React Router is a library that allows developers to add routing functionality to their React applications. It provides a way to handle client-side routing in a single-page application (SPA) by synchronizing the application's UI with the URL in the browser address bar.

React Router is often used in conjunction with the React library, but it can also be used with other libraries or frameworks. It allows you to define the routes of your application as components, making it easier to manage the state and rendering of your application based on the current URL.

React Router provides several components for defining and handling routes, such as `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Switch>`, `<Route>`, and `<Link>`. These components allow you to define the URL structure of your application, render specific components for each URL, and navigate between different routes.

React Router can be a powerful tool for building modern web applications, particularly those that rely on client-side routing to provide a seamless user experience.
